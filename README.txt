Pong is a classic arcade game, probably one of the first arcade games ever created. The premise is simple: a ball moves across a table while two players each control a paddle to bounce the ball back and forth. If a player misses the ball, the opposing player scores a point.

The steps include:

Creating the screen
Creating and moving a paddle
Creating a second paddle for a two-player game
Creating the ball and making it move constantly across the screen
Detecting collisions with walls and making the ball bounce back
Detecting collisions with paddles to bounce the ball back
Detecting when a player scores by missing the ball
Keeping score using a scoreboard
